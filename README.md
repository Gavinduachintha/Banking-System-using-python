This is a intermidiate level banking system using python and JSON.
This system has account oppening / depositing money / withdrawing money and checking the balance.
I have added 2 JSON files which are memorize the account number and the account holder's name and
the other json file memorize the transaction details of each account and update the account balance according to the each particular transaction.
